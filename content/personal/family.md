# Family of Hein Daanen

Hein Daanen is married to Elly Rentes March 3th in 1991.  
Two children are born: Paul and Emma.  
As a hobby Hein started to make an inventory of the family members, helped by several others. Now a database is constructed of over 2000 family members. The database is processed with the program Family Tree Maker. It is also available in Gedcom format.  
The family is available on this website. _Andr√© van Eck_ is acknowledged for his contribution. The Daanen family comes from Beuningen in the province of Gelderland.  
The mother of Hein is Joke **Savelkouls**. Thanks to _Frans Savelkouls_ in Oisterwijk, almost 1000 family members of the Savelkouls family are to my disposal. The roots are in Limburg, in the South of The Netherlands.  
The father of Elly, _Henk Rentes_, took care for the data of the **Rentes** family, originating from Friesland in Northern Netherlands.  
The family of the mother of Elly, Bep **Maat** is also available in detail, thanks to _Betty Maat_. The Maat family and the family Van der Plas (grandma of Elly) originate from Katwijk a/d Zee, a fishermans town at the West coast.
